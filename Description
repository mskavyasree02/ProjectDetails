Unveiling the Potential of Audio Classification for Poultry Health Diagnosis: A Deep Learning Approach
* Developed a deep learning model for audio classification to diagnose poultry health, enhancing early disease 
detection.
* Implemented advanced signal processing and neural network techniques to achieve high accuracy in 
identifying poultry vocalization patterns.
* The model aids in early intervention and treatment planning for poultry health issues.
Challenges:
1: Data Quality and Labeling: Obtaining high-quality audio data and accurately labeling it for training the model was difficult due to the variability in poultry vocalizations and background noise.
2: Model Generalization: Ensuring that the model could generalize well across different poultry breeds and environments required extensive testing and validation, given the diversity in vocalization patterns.
